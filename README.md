We Rate Dogs Twitter feed analysis : A Data Wrangling Project
As part of the Data Analyst Nano-Degree, I worked on analyzing the We Rate Dog Twitter account's tweets. We Rate Dogs' twitter feeds mainly consists of Dog pictures, sometimes videos and sometimes people also post other animals photos. Data for the project came from following three sources:
Udacity's archive csv file containing tweets from 2015-11-15 to 2017-08-01.
Image predictions downloaded from the internet using Requests library
Full tweet infoormation from Twitter using Tweepy API
Data Wrangling consists of the following steps:
Data Gathering
Assessment
Data Cleaning
The important thing to keep in mind is that this is an iterative process depending on the type of questions we are trying to answer.
